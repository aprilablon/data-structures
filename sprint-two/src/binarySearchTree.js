/*Implement a binarySearchTree class with the following properties:
A .left property, a binary search tree (BST) where all values are lower than than it the current value.
A .right property, a BST where all values are higher than than it the current value.
A .insert() method, which accepts a value and places in the tree in the correct position.
A .contains() method, which accepts a value and returns a boolean reflecting whether or not the value is contained in the tree.
A .depthFirstLog() method, which accepts a callback and executes it on every value contained in the tree.
